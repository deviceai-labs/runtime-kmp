# Code of Conduct

## Our Standards

- Be respectful and constructive in all interactions.
- Focus on the technical problem, not the person.
- Welcome contributors of all experience levels.
- No harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks.

## Scope

This applies to all project spaces — GitHub issues, PRs, discussions, and any other communication related to this project.

## Enforcement

Violations can be reported by opening a private issue or contacting the maintainer directly via GitHub. Maintainers reserve the right to remove comments or ban users who violate these standards.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1.
